# Word Scramble 
## Problem
Create a game in Python that enables a user to select a word length and be given a scrambled word of that length. The user can guess the word and be told if the input was correct or not, along with a list of all correct answers. No packages except *random* and *sys* can be used. The program should accept a txt file with a list of words to include in the game, the NLTK set of over 200k words is added here.
## To Run
On the command line run:
```
WordScramble.py nltk.235886.words.txt
```
The program will kick off with various inputs requested from the user.
